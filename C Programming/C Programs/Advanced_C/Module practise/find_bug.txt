There are several bugs and issues in the given code:

Misuse of the iseven macro: The iseven macro is defined to check if a number is even, 
but it uses a bitwise AND operation (&) with 1, which will always result in 0 or 1, 
not necessarily indicating evenness. It should use the modulo operator (%) instead.

Incorrect condition in the while loop: In the while loop, the condition i = 10 is used,
which is an assignment rather than a comparison. It should be i == 10.

Uninitialized variable j: The variable j is used without initialization in the foo function,
which can lead to undefined behavior.

Unreachable code in the switch statement:
The switch statement has no break statements after each case,
so if j is 10, it will also execute the case for 20. Additionally,
the default case tries to print a string (%s), but j is of type char,
leading to undefined behavior.

Return type mismatch: The function foo is declared to return an int, but it returns p,
which is a pointer to int.

Inefficient loop: The loop inside foo assigns even numbers to the arr array. However, 
this loop runs indefinitely as there is no mechanism to increment i.
