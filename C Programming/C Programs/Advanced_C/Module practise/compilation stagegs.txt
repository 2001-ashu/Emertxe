Preprocessor
Compiler
Assembler
Linker

Firstly, the input file, i.e., hello.c, is passed to
 the preprocessor, and the preprocessor converts the
  source code into expanded source code. The extension
   of the expanded source code would be hello.i.
The expanded source code is passed to the compiler,
 and the compiler converts this expanded source code
  into assembly code. The extension of the assembly 
  code would be hello.s.
This assembly code is then sent to the assembler,
 which converts the assembly code into object code.
After the creation of an object code, the linker create
s the executable file. The loader will then load the executable file for the execution.
